Hi Team,

when i was testing your website i found the many subdomain

i was intreasted in community.2key.io/

I check all the possible ways in all test, there i saw there is a option to product the account using Google authenticator app

so i try to make bypass of 2FA

steps to reproduce:

• Go to https://community.2key.io/ and make login.
• Next, it will ask for the 2FA code in google Authenticator (enabled 2FA).
• By seeing the code enter the value, after entering the value make intercept the data and do response to this request.
• See the create response and copy it.
• Now logout the account, and try to get login with fake authentication code.
• Now make intercept and response to this request , there will be unauthendicated.
• Delete the response of UNAUTHORIZED and place the response of authorized,Forward it.
• 2FA bypassed.
